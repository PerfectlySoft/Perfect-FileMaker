This project provides access to FileMaker Server databases using the XML Web publishing interface.

This package builds with Swift Package Manager and is part of the [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) project. It was written to be stand-alone and so does not need to be run as part of a Perfect server application.

Ensure you have installed and activated the latest Swift 3.0 tool chain.
